GENERAL

-------------------------------------------------------

A. The Company maintains an ongoing EULA enforcement program. Violation of any provision in this EULA automatically terminates this EULA and may subject you to civil and/or criminal prosecution at the Company's sole discretion.

 

B. Your payment of the license fee grants you a LIMITED, PERSONAL, and NON EXCLUSIVE license to use Program and Documentation in accordance with all of the terms stated in this EULA. This license is NON TRANSFERABLE except as expressly permitted in this EULA or by US copyright law.

 

C. You expressly acknowledge that the Company has a valuable proprietary interest in both the Program and the Documentation. All title, ownership, and rights to the Program and the Documentation not expressly granted to you by this EULA and applicable laws remain with the Company. 

 

D. You cannot use, copy, modify, derive, or transfer Program or Documentation or any copy, modification, derivation, or merged portion thereof in whole or in part via any means or for any purpose whatsoever except as expressly provided in this EULA.

 

E. You assume full responsibility for your selection of the Program to achieve your intended results and for the installation, use, and results you obtain from the Program. 

 

F. You may only use the Program on a single computer, meaning that you must treat the Program like a book. "Like a book" means that the Program may be used by any number of people and may be freely moved from one computer to another so long as no possibility exists of the Program being used at more than one computer simultaneously. More than one person at a time cannot read the same copy of a book, and this restriction applies to the Program. The Company is pleased to offer site licenses for multiple simultaneous users. Please contact the Company at the address below for details.

 

G. You, your employees, and/or authorized agents must protect the Program's confidentiality and act to enforce this EULA. You cannot distribute or otherwise make the Program or Documentation available to any third party via any means whatsoever, public or private, for any purpose, commercial or not, unless explicitly allowed by either this EULA or applicable US copyright law.

 

H. You may not copy or reproduce the Program or the Documentation except to make one (1) archival copy of the Program for your personal backup purposes, in support of your using the Program in full compliance with this EULA. You may not transfer this archival copy or permit this archival copy to be transferred to any other person or entity via any public or private means whatsoever, whether for compensation or not, unless this archival copy is part of a one-time permanent transfer of the Program, the Documentation, and all rights to use the Program and the Documentation granted by this EULA. Further, you must reproduce and include the Company's copyright notice on the archival copy of the Program. Company retains full ownership, title, and all other rights to the copy of the Program contained on your archival media, and all of the terms of this EULA apply to this archival copy as if it was the original Company-produced copy of the Program that was furnished to you when you paid the licensing fee.

 

I. You cannot reverse engineer, decompile, debug, disassemble, circumvent security features, or interfere with the normal Program functionality and operation for any reason whatsoever without the express prior written consent of the Company. Any such activity performed without the required consent is a violation of this EULA that may subject you to civil and/or criminal prosecution at the Company's sole discretion.

K. The sale of legal copies of the Program and the Documentation is restricted in accordance with US copyright law and any existing distributor and/or reseller agreements currently in effect between the Company and authorized distributors/resellers. This EULA does not grant the user the ability to act as a reseller of the Product or the Documentation. You may perform one permanent transfer of assignment of your personal copy of the Program, the Documentation, and this End User License Agreement as permitted under US copyright law provided all materials shipped with the Product (including the Program, the Documentation, the Allowed Content, the Restricted Content, and all rights granted by the EULA) are complete and unaltered and that all copies in your possession in original and converted forms are transferred. The party receiving the permanent transfer must accept the terms and conditions of this EULA and any other terms and conditions upon which you legally purchased a license to the Program.

- Creating Torque scripts limited to use within the Program, not for resale.

 

J. As part of the legitimate uses for Restricted Content outlined above, you may reproduce, distribute, sell, copyright, publicly display, and publicly perform using Restricted Content provided that such activity is limited to the Legitimate Uses enumerated above and does not violate any other clauses in this agreement and/or applicable US copyright laws.
